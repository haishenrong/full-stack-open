This is the git repo for my submissions for the Full Stack open course at:
https://fullstackopen.com/en/

Although I am not officially a student at the University of Helsinki:

Each commit pushed labeled "Part X" represents my following of the course. eg. Classwork

Each commit pushed labeled "Exercises X" represents my submission to the 
respective exercises outlined in the course as if I were taking this course
as a student. eg. Homework
